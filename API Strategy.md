# API Designer
## Introduction to API's
 - Programmatic interface
 - The business value of API's or API economy
 - API's are digital enablers
 - Business benefits of APIs
 -  New Revenue, e.g. google maps and Twilio
 -  Reach and Retention: APIs allow content and service privders to reach capative audiences where they spend their time
 -  Faster partnerships e.g. KAYAK, GreenButton allaiance
 -  Mobile and Omnichannel - e.g. amazon, Disney API
 -  Interaction analysis by data driven insights e.g. Disney, Mastercard
 - Outsourced Innovation e.g. netflix API used by XBox and Playstation
 - Self-Service Integration - Amazon
 - Organizational Agility - API first engineering philosphy along with microservices architecture
## The API 360 model
### Focus on
- Engagement and Usability
- Scalability and Evolvability
- Manageability and Security
- Alignment and Usefulness
## API Styles
 -  Tunnel style(SOAP)
 -  URI Style (CRUD)
 -  Hypermedia Style(REST)
 -  Event Driven/Reactive style
 -  GraphQL
 -  gRPC
## Designing API's for developers
### Good Design
- Functionality, usability and experience
## Overcoming API Design obstacles
 -  Cost
 -  Scalability
 -  Security
## Architecting your API
### Qualities of a Well-designed API
#### Functional requirements
-   Security
-   Usability
#### Non-functional requirements
-   Scalability
-   Reliability
-   Testability
### Understanding the requirements of a well designed API
 - Security : The API is protected against attacks and misuse
 - Usability : The API is easy for developers for easy leverage
 - Scalability : The API is able to handle rapid spikes in traffic
 - Testability : The API is designed to help developers experiment with functionality
 - Reliability : The API is robust enough to minimise downtime

### Layered Architecture Style
 - Security Layer
 - Caching Layer - Provides optimized response handling to offload backend application processing
 - Presentation Layer - Provides a consumer centric view of the data or service that an API is exposing
 - Orchestration Layer - Aggregates and composes data from multiple backend sources
### Steps to basic API design approach
 - Determine goals
 - Identify users
 - Design interface
 - Evaluate
 - Implement
 
## API change Management
- API Versioning
- API versioning principles
- Avoid possible issues when extending the interface
